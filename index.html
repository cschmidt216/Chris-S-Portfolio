      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I go by Chris and I am a full-stack web developer currently receiving my certificate from Case Western Reserve Universitys’ coding bootcamp.  I come from a lifetime of being fascinated with technology, and although initially I chose to pursue the arts, (more specifically music composition and piano performance) I have now decided to pivot towards a career towards the tech world in the hopes of building a stable and profitable career.  As a kid who somehow grew up enjoying math, coding offers a similar logical challenge to be solved that I find to be rewarding and occasionally insightful towards how technology I already know functions.  Although I am still a novice, I find the most drive when working on mainly Javascript, as I grew up fiddling with video games built in Java so the syntax is very familiar to me (although I am well aware of the differences between the two!), and I do not enjoy designing the web page a user would be presented with.  I wouldn’t say there is any sort of dream project I’d be passionate about working on, I think passion is a lousy motivator and find more reward from completing whatever challenge I may be presented with.  If it wasn't apparent as well, dogs and other animals are a huge part of my life and I was planning to pursue a veterinary career before settling on web development.  My dog pictured above was a rescue with serious behavioral issues, and working with her so she can coexist with people again has been a hugely rewarding process.  Thank you for your time and I hope to have much more exciting things to show off here in the future!</p>
