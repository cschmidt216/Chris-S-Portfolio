      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I go by Chris and I am a full-stack web developer having recently received a certificate from Case Western Reserve University'sâ€™ coding bootcamp. I come from a lifetime of being fascinated with technology, and although initially I chose to pursue the arts, (more specifically music composition and piano performance) I have now decided to pivot towards a career towards the tech world in the hopes of building a stable and profitable career. I am focused on pursuing web design currently, as the importance of a good website cannot be understated in this day and age. I see a website as the digital face of a company or business, so proper presentation is crucial. While my course and my focus is web design, I am familiar with many other languages and development processes, as I've had a hobby of making video games since I was a teenager. If it wasn't apparent as well, dogs and other animals are a huge part of my life and I was planning to pursue a veterinary career before settling on web development. My dog pictured above is a rescue with serious behavioral issues, and working with her so she can coexist with people again has been a hugely rewarding process.  Thank you for your time and I hope to have more exciting things to show off here in the future!</p>
